# Warehouse Space Optimization

This project aims to optimize warehouse space by utilizing a Streamlit web application to input warehouse dimensions, obstacles, product dimensions, demand, current supply, and fragility. The application creates a 3D matrix representing the warehouse layout and employs a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal placement of products based on various factors.

## Features

- **Input Warehouse Details:** Users can input dimensions of the warehouse, including length, width, and height, as well as specify entrances, obstacles, and pathways.
  
- **Product Information:** Users provide details of each product, including dimensions, demand, current supply, and fragility (boolean value).
  
- **3D Matrix Representation:** The application generates a 3D matrix representing the warehouse layout, considering obstacles and pathways.

- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization:** Based on product dimensions, demand, current supply, and fragility, the genetic algorithm determines the optimal placement of products within the warehouse to maximize space utilization and minimize retrieval times.
